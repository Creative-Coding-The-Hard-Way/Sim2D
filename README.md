# Sim2D

A tiny 2d creative coding environment for 2d simulations and graphics.

## TODO

- document shader inputs / outputs / bindings in doc for the Material type
- add "projection" property to meshes, use a buffer + addressing to index / track.
- add clip support to meshes with a reasonable default (maybe it's optional?)
- rename graphics2 to "StreamingRenderer" with associated doc updates
- adjust Vertex format to make pos a vec3 since there is space for it when
  accounting for padding

## Examples
